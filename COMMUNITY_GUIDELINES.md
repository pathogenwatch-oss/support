# Discussion Forum Guidelines for Pathogenwatch

# Why
We never really expect to have to enforce these standards on the question and answer forum for an infectious disease genomics website. But just in case, please follow the rules below.

## Rule 1: Stay On Topic

This forum is specific to Pathogenwatch. While there some more general discussions around genomics platforms in public health may develop, we wish to keep moderation to a minimum.
In practice this means being strict about the topics being discussed
We hope the remaining rules are largely irrelevant, but we feel they are best stated explicitly.

## This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion
Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.

These are not hard and fast rules, merely guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a clean and well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.


## Improve the Discussion
Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.


## Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree
You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:

 - Name-calling
 - Ad hominem attacks
 - Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content
 - Knee-jerk contradiction  
Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.


## Your Participation Counts
The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.

Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.

Let’s leave our community better than we found it.


## If You See a Problem, Flag It
If you see a spam message, or someone has come to post their latest conspiracy theory, or something else that's nothing to Pathogenwatch, please do let one of our team know.
You can contact us directly by email on pathongenwatch@cgps.group

## Always Be Civil
Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

 - Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
 - Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
 - Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
 - Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.
 - These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.

This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.


## Keep It Tidy
Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:

 - Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.
 - Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
 - Don’t post no-content replies.
 - Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
 - Don’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.
 - Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the upvoyte button.


## Post Only Your Own Stuff
You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.
